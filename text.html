Okay, the user wants to solve the expression 1 - 5 * 3 / 2. Let me think about the order of operations here. According to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are done before subtraction. So first, I need to calculate 5 * 3, which is 15. Then divide that by 2, giving 7.5. Now subtract that from 1: 1 - 7.5 equals -6.5. Wait, but maybe I should use the eval function as provided. Let me check the tools again. The function solve_expression takes an expression as a string. So I can input "1-5<em>3/2" directly. The eval function should handle the operations correctly. Let me make sure there are no parentheses or other complexities. The expression is straightforward. So the answer should be -6.5. I'll call the function with the expression.

Okay, the user asked to solve 1 - 5 * 3 / 2. Let me break it down step by step. First, according to order of operations, multiplication and division happen before subtraction. So I need to calculate 5 * 3 first, which is 15. Then divide that by 2, resulting in 7.5. Now subtract that from 1: 1 - 7.5 equals -6.5. The tool call would use the solve_expression function with the expression "1-5*3/2". The function should return -6.5. I should confirm the calculation is correct and present the final answer.

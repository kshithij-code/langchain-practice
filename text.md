solve 1-5*3/2
<think>
Okay, the user asked to solve 1 - 5 * 3 / 2. Let me break it down step by step. First, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division happen before subtraction. So I calculate 5 * 3 = 15, then divide by 2, which is 7.5. Now subtract that from 1: 1 - 7.5 = -6.5. The tool called solve_expression evaluated the expression correctly. The result is -6.5. I should present this as the final answer.

The result of evaluating $1 - 5 \times 3 \div 2$ is $\boxed{-6.5}$.

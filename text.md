Okay, the user is asking for today's important news. Let me check the available tools. There's a function called get_info which retrieves today's news. I don't need any parameters for that. So I should call get_info to fetch the news. Let me make sure there's no other functions related to news. The other functions are for solving expressions and getting the date. So definitely, get_info is the right choice here. I'll generate the tool call accordingly.
